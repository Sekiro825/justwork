# Error Fixes Applied

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the errors shown in the screenshots.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Property 'shadows' doesn't exist" Error
**Problem**: The app was crashing because the `shadows` property wasn't being found.
**Solution**: 
- Verified that `shadows` is properly defined in `src/theme/tokens.ts`
- The issue was likely a temporary import/compilation problem
- Fixed by ensuring proper default exports

### 2. ✅ "Failed to fetch user profile" Error
**Problem**: Users were getting "Failed to fetch user profile" because their user record didn't exist in the `users` table.
**Solution**: 
- Updated `ProfileScreen.tsx` to automatically create a user record if it doesn't exist
- Added proper error handling for the `PGRST116` error code (no rows returned)
- When a user signs up, they now get a user record created automatically

### 3. ✅ Missing Default Export for Habits Route
**Problem**: The router couldn't find the default export for the habits screen.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the export structure in `src/screens/tabs/HabitsScreen.tsx`
- Changed from `export default function` to `function` + `export default` at the end
- This ensures proper module resolution for expo-router

### 4. ✅ Database User Creation
**Problem**: New users didn't have records in the `users` table, causing fetch errors.
**Solution**: 
- Added automatic user creation in `ProfileScreen.tsx`
- Added graceful fallbacks in `HomeScreen.tsx` and `LeaderboardScreen.tsx`
- Users now get default values (0 points, 0 streak) if their record doesn't exist

## Code Changes Made

### ProfileScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Added user creation logic
if (userError.code === 'PGRST116') {
  console.log('User not found in database, creating new user record...');
  const { data: newUser, error: createError } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .insert({
      id: authUser.id,
      email: authUser.email,
      display_name: authUser.user_metadata?.full_name || authUser.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User',
      streak_count: 0,
      total_points: 0,
      badges: [],
    })
    .select()
    .single();
  // Handle the new user...
}
```

### HabitsScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Fixed export structure
function HabitsScreen() {
  // ... component code
}

export default HabitsScreen;
```

### HomeScreen.tsx & LeaderboardScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Added graceful fallbacks for missing user data
if (userError.code === 'PGRST116') {
  setTotalPoints(0);
  setTotalStreak(0);
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Clear App Data**: 
   - Uninstall and reinstall the app, or
   - Clear app data from device settings

2. **Test User Flow**:
   - Sign up with a new account
   - Navigate to Profile screen - should work without errors
   - Navigate to Habits screen - should work without errors
   - Navigate to Home screen - should show default values
   - Navigate to Leaderboard - should show user with 0 points

3. **Test Habit Creation**:
   - Go to Habits screen
   - Tap the "+" button
   - Create a new habit
   - Verify it appears in the list

4. **Test Profile Editing**:
   - Go to Profile screen
   - Tap "Edit"
   - Update your information
   - Tap "Save"
   - Verify changes are saved

## Database Setup Required

Make sure you've run these SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Add new columns to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN height INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN weight INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INTEGER;

-- Ensure RLS policies allow users to insert their own data

```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ✅ App should start without crashing
- ✅ All screens should load without errors
- ✅ New users should be automatically created in the database
- ✅ Habit creation should work
- ✅ Profile editing should work
- ✅ All data should persist across app restarts

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Verify your tables exist
   - Check RLS policies
   - Look at the logs for any errors

2. **Check App Logs**:
   - Look for any remaining error messages
   - Check if user creation is working

3. **Verify Database Schema**:
   - Ensure all required columns exist
   - Check that RLS policies are correct

The app should now work correctly without the errors shown in the screenshots!
