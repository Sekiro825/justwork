# GlowUp AI - Feature Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the new habit creation and profile update features to ensure they work correctly with the Supabase backend.

## Prerequisites

1. **Database Setup**: Make sure you've run the SQL commands from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` to add the new columns to your users table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN height INTEGER;
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN weight INTEGER;
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INTEGER;
   ```

2. **App Configuration**: Ensure your `app.json` has the correct Supabase URL and anon key.

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Scenarios
- All forms should validate input correctly
- Success messages should appear for successful operations
- Data should persist across app restarts
- UI should update immediately after successful operations
- Loading states should be shown during operations

### ‚ùå Error Scenarios
- Network errors should show appropriate error messages
- Invalid input should show validation errors
- Authentication errors should redirect to login
- Database errors should show user-friendly messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"User not authenticated" Error**
   - Solution: Sign out and sign back in
   - Check if your Supabase session is valid

2. **"Failed to create habit" Error**
   - Check your Supabase RLS policies
   - Ensure the habits table exists and has correct permissions

3. **"Failed to update profile" Error**
   - Check if the new columns (height, weight, age) exist in your users table
   - Verify RLS policies allow users to update their own data

4. **Data Not Persisting**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Supabase configuration in app.json
   - Check Supabase dashboard for any errors

### Database Verification

You can verify data persistence by checking your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to Table Editor**
2. **Check `habits` table** - Should see your new habits
3. **Check `users` table** - Should see updated profile information

## Performance Notes

- Habit creation should be fast (< 2 seconds)
- Profile updates should be fast (< 2 seconds)
- App should handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Loading states should provide good user feedback

## Security Notes

- All data is protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Input validation prevents malicious data entry
- Authentication is required for all operations
